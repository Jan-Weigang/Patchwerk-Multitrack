May I use these multitracks for classroom assignments and audio demonstrations within a formal teaching context?

Absolutely. Providing useful classroom materials for teachers was one of the primary reasons I set up the resource in the first place. 
If you have any problems using the multitracks within your own school/college environment, please do let me know 
so that I can make the library as user-friendly and accessible as possible for educators. The only proviso is that you aren’t premitted to package these multitracks into any kind of 
commercial teaching product (such an instructional DVD for sale, say) – for that kind of use, please contact the relevant multitrack contributors directly for permission. 
I’d also advise against stock-piling downloaded multitrack ZIPs on your own local school/college server, simply because I do repair/improve these archive files from time to time 
in response to feedback from library users.
